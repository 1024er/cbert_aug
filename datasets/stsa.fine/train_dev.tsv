too ordinary to restore -lrb- harmon -rrb- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .	2
highly watchable stuff .	4
exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere .	4
there 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .	2
